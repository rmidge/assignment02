## Instructions

Write a query to answer each of the questions below.
* Your queries should produce results in the format specified by each question.
* Write your query in a SQL file corresponding to the question number (e.g. a file named _query06.sql_ for the answer to question #6).
* Each SQL file should contain a single query that retrieves data from the database (i.e. a `SELECT` query).
* Some questions include a request for you to discuss your methods. Update this README file with your answers in the appropriate place.

### Initial database structure

There are several datasets that are prescribed for you to use in this part. Below you will find table creation DDL statements that define the initial structure of your tables. Over the course of the assignment you may end up adding columns or indexes to these initial table structures. **You should put SQL that you use to modify the schema (e.g. SQL that creates indexes or update columns) should in the _db_structure.sql_ file.**

  *   `census.population_2020` ([Census Explorer](https://data.census.gov/table?t=Populations+and+People&g=040XX00US42$1500000&y=2020&d=DEC+Redistricting+Data+(PL+94-171)&tid=DECENNIALPL2020.P1))  
      * In the tests, the initial table will have the following structure:
        ```sql
        CREATE TABLE census.population_2020 (
            geoid TEXT,
            geoname TEXT,
            total INTEGER
        );
        ```
      * Note that the file from the Census Explorer will have more fields than those three. You may have to do some data preprocessing to get the data into the correct format.

        Alternatively you can use the results from the [Census API](https://api.census.gov/data/2020/dec/pl?get=NAME,GEO_ID,P1_001N&for=block%20group:*&in=state:42%20county:*), but you'll still have to transform the JSON that it gives you into a CSV.

## Questions

1.  Which **eight** bus stop have the largest population within 800 meters? As a rough estimation, consider any block group that intersects the buffer as being part of the 800 meter buffer.
   
   Lombard St & 18th St

2.  Which **eight** bus stops have the smallest population above 500 people _inside of Philadelphia_ within 800 meters of the stop (Philadelphia county block groups have a geoid prefix of `42101` -- that's `42` for the state of PA, and `101` for Philadelphia county)?

    Answer:
	"Delaware Av & Tioga St"    
	"Delaware Av & Castor Av"
	"Delaware Av & Venango St"
	"Stenton Av & Northwestern Av"
	"Northwestern Av & Stenton Av"
	"Bethlehem Pk & Chesney Ln"
	"Bethlehem Pk & Chesney Ln"
	"Delaware Av & Wheatsheaf Ln"

3.  Using the Philadelphia Water Department Stormwater Billing Parcels dataset, pair each parcel with its closest bus stop. The final result should give the parcel address, bus stop name, and distance apart in meters, rounded to two decimals. Order by distance (largest on top).

    First 5 rows;
	"170 SPRING LN"	"Ridge Av & Ivins Rd"	1658.82
	"150 SPRING LN"	"Ridge Av & Ivins Rd"	1620.32
	"130 SPRING LN"	"Ridge Av & Ivins Rd"	1611.02
	"190 SPRING LN"	"Ridge Av & Ivins Rd"	1490.10
	"630 SAINT ANDREW RD"	"Germantown Av & Springfield Av "	1418.42 

4.  Using the `bus_shapes`, `bus_routes`, and `bus_trips` tables from GTFS bus feed, find the **two** routes with the longest trips.

    Answer: 
    "130"	"Bucks County Community College"
    "128"	"Oxford Valley Mall"

5.  Rate neighborhoods by their bus stop accessibility for wheelchairs. Use OpenDataPhilly's neighborhood dataset along with an appropriate dataset from the Septa GTFS bus feed. Use the [GTFS documentation](https://gtfs.org/reference/static/) for help. Use some creativity in the metric you devise in rating neighborhoods.


    Discuss your accessibility metric and how you arrived at it below:

    **Description:**
   My accessibility metric combines both the total number of bus stops in each neighborhood (transit coverage) and the percentage of those stops that are wheelchair accessible (wheelchair_boarding = 1). This approach highlights neighborhoods that not only have a high proportion of accessible stops, but also a high absolute number of stops, reflecting both the quality and quantity of accessible transit infrastructure.   

6.  What are the _top five_ neighborhoods according to your accessibility metric?
    Answer:
    "OVERBROOK"
    "OLNEY"
    "SOMERTON"	
    "BUSTLETON"
    "LOGAN"


7.  What are the _bottom five_ neighborhoods according to your accessibility metric?
    Answer:
    "BARTRAM_VILLAGE"
    "MECHANICSVILLE"
    "WOODLAND_TERRACE"
    "SOUTHWEST_SCHUYLKILL"
    "PASCHALL"
  

8.  With a query, find out how many census block groups Penn's main campus fully contains. Discuss which dataset you chose for defining Penn's campus.

   
  Answer: 17

    **Discussion:**
     To define the spatial extent of Penn’s main campus, I used a GeoJSON file representing a buffered zone around the campus, which closely aligns with the official Penn Patrol Zone. According to the University of Pennsylvania Division of Public Safety, the Penn Patrol Zone covers the area from 30th Street to 43rd Street (east to west) and from Market Street to Baltimore Avenue (north to south). This area represents the primary jurisdiction for campus police and is widely recognized as the core of Penn’s campus for operational and safety purposes.

9.  With a query involving PWD parcels and census block groups, find the `geo_id` of the block group that contains Meyerson Hall. `ST_MakePoint()` and functions like that are not allowed.
    
    Answer: "421010369022"


10. You're tasked with giving more contextual information to rail stops to fill the `stop_desc` field in a GTFS feed. Using any of the data sets above, PostGIS functions (e.g., `ST_Distance`, `ST_Azimuth`, etc.), and PostgreSQL string functions, build a description (alias as `stop_desc`) for each stop. Feel free to supplement with other datasets (must provide link to data used so it's reproducible), and other methods of describing the relationships. SQL's `CASE` statements may be helpful for some operations.

    **Structure:**
    ```sql
    (
        stop_id integer,
        stop_name text,
        stop_desc text,
        stop_lon double precision,
        stop_lat double precision
    )
    ```

   As an example, your `stop_desc` for a station stop may be something like "37 meters NE of 1234 Market St" (that's only an example, feel free to be creative, silly, descriptive, etc.)

   >**Tip when experimenting:** Use subqueries to limit your query to just a few rows to keep query times faster. Once your query is giving you answers you want, scale it up. E.g., instead of `FROM tablename`, use `FROM (SELECT * FROM tablename limit 10) as t`.
